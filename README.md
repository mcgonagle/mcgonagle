# README

This document is a work in progress; it's creation has helped me identify and refine my thoughts and values. My hope is that it gives you some insights into how to work with me more effectively. This is not a replacement for actually getting to know each other. I very much value human interaction and look forward to connecting in person.

## What's Most Important to Thomas
Friends and Family

## Brahmavihara
Thomas has many tatoos that are important to him, but one that is literally close to his heart is the Brahmavihara. 
Practicing the Brahmavihara causes the practioner to be reborn into the “Brahma realm,” radiating:

* Loving-kindness
* Compassion
* Empathetic joy
* Equanimity

A blog article Thomas wrote on the Brahmavihara and DevOps can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bramavihara-four-immeasurables-devops-thomas-a-mcgonagle/). 

## Favorite Poem
[Invictus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus)

## Leadership Brand
Thomas' [super power](https://drodio.com/what-is-your-leadership-brand/) is *invincibility*. 

## Preparedness
 Thomas' personal slogan is *In Omnia Paratus* which means prepared in all things, or "ready for anything". Being organized and ready for anything makes him most comfortable and ready to take on the world. One way this manifests itself is as his being a mobile productivity nerd. He carries a large backpack and a small daypack full of everything he needs to get the job done whatever that job is. It also manifests itself as his need to be prepared for meetings and client engagements. 

## Productivity
Thomas is a productivity buff, generally he wakes early and spends a considerable part of each morning getting organized. This is not to say that organization comes easily to Thomas. He has to work on it every day, but has a very good workflow he would be happy to share with anyone. 

## Life Long Learner
Thomas strives to be a lifelong learner. Although he feels like he is slowing down.

## Teacher/Trainer
Thomas' maternal grandfather [James L. Greene](https://twitter.com/mcgonagle/status/1041195328756690950/photo/1) was a high school history teacher for 35 years. He always said that the best teaching he encountered was in the Army, where they "told you what they were going to teach you, taught you, and then tested you". Thomas brings this approach to his trainings. He also is a firm beliver in the socratic method. His personal style refined while teaching junior college computer engineering courses for three years is to ask a lot of questions and hopefully spark lots of discussion. 

## Military Family
  Thomas comes from a very military family and this has definitely shaped him. His family has fought and served in every war going back to the [revolutionary war](https://twitter.com/mcgonagle/status/1041192434816962560). He didn't serve, but considers his 7 years working for the FAA as a contractor to be his civil service to the country.  

## Professionality 
 Boston is a very reserved business culture. Thomas went to a business-focused school for undergraduate and graduate school, and the combination of growing up in Boston and coming up going to Bentley has shaped him. He is most comfortable being formal with customers. With that said, he is certainly capable of creating high quality relationships with customers. Thomas is proud to say that he has become friends with several customers and sees them socially outside of work. 

## disAbility and Burnout
Thomas is a disAbility and Burnout awareness activist. He has lead special interest groups at previous employers promoting awareness of disAbility and strives to make every work place as equatable as possible. Thomas co-hosts a peer support talk show on Burnout for the CNCF community on Thursdays at 12PM ET.
